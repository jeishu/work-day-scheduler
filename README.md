## Reference

These are websites I used to aid me in learning different syntax and different methods, functions, etc for Javascript.

> - [Developer Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) || Learn a good amount of methods and functions here.
> - [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) || I pulled some questions fro the JavaScript quiz there and some questions I replaced with my own answers.
> - [StackOverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com/) || Most issues I had were resolved from looking at other people's problems.

These websites aid me in creating this README.

> - [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) || Learn most of my README syntax here.
> - [Akash Nimare](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3) || Based my README from his person.
> - [Mark Down Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) || README Syntax
