## Code-Example

I used template literals to append the content from JS to HTML. A For Loop was used to create 8 of these from 9AM to 5PM.
Notice I also use ${} in the template literals to grab values from JS. And you can see Bootstrap Classes are also used within the code.
```
containerEl.append(`
        
        <div class="row time-block" data-time="${hour}">

        <!-- hours -->
            <div class="col-sm col-md-2 hour">
            <p>${moment({hour}).format("h  a")}</p>
            </div>

        <!-- schedule -->
            <div class="col-sm col-md-10 d-flex p-0 description">
            <div class="input-group">
                <textarea class="form-control text-area"></textarea>
                <div class="input-group-append">
                <button class="saveBtn d-flex justify-content-center align-items-center">
                    <i class="far fa-save fa-2x save-icon"></i>
                </button>
                </div>
            </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        `);
```

## Tests/Issues/Notes

* Had some issues getting the colors to show present, past and future, but turns out that I forgot that future color is green. So me working at night got the color confused and spent several hours fixing something that was already working correctly
* Syntax errors again... Less code problem, more me problem. I tend to type too fast and misspell class names and or IDs. (」°ロ°)」
* Main errors is figure out how $(this) works. I was using the actual $("") selector rather than $(this). So figuring out $(this) is a life saver. Spent a good 2 days learning it.
* I utilized Bootstrap class for some CSS-ing and as well as my own CSS overriding some of it. The Bootstrap class CSS was used in the template Literals.
* I also commented out the pre-exsisting CSS and replace with my own.
* I used template literals with backticks to create and render the amount of time needed into the HTML. Each render was done with a for loop and ${} notion inside the template literals. I was very proud of this. (´ ∀ ` *) 
* Console log, console log. I console logged almost everything to check values, typeof variables, functions etc.
